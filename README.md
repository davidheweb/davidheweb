# About me 🗣️
Hey! My name is David, I am currently doing an internship as a Software Engineer while I study a computer engineer degree at a distance learning university. Besides, I am a Higher Technician in Multi-platform & Web Applications Development.

I consider myself a “geek”, specially interested in programming and web development. I have a natural drive to learn and to overcome new challenges.

Team player with strong communication skills and ability to multitask. Acquired organizational techniques through my daily experience coordinating a valunteer team and, more recently, in my previous job as an Apple devices app developer at Babel.
